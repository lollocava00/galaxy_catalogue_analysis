# galaxy_catalogue_analysis
The project will consist of an analysis of a catalog of galaxies extracted from the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey (SDSS, http://www.sdss3.org/index.php).
The catalog provides several properties of a subsample of 75000 galaxies:
positions (RA, DEC, redshift);
magnitudes in different bands (u, g, r, i, z), with relative errors;
physical properties (stellar mass, star-formation rate);
measurement of emission lines.

The main steps of the project will be:
Step I - Reading the catalog and selection of the subsample;
Step II - Measurement of the statistical distribution of various properties;
Step III - Measurement of the evolution of the properties of the sample;
Step IV - Analysis of diagrams.

The catalog is provided in fits format (data_SDSS_info.fit), containing different columns. 

A more in depth analisys of the third step is given in file: Relazione_Step_3.pdf
